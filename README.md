# Reinforcement-Learning-suite

This repository is related to Reinforcement Learning. There are projects which are simpler, whereas other are more advanced and complex. For the time being there are currently 3 projects:
- **Basic Principles in Tabular Value-Based Reinforcement Learning**: carrying out experiments with algorithms such as Value Iteration (Dynamic Programming) and Model-free algorithms like Q-learning, SARSA, N-step and Monte Carlo. Environment used is Stochastic Windy Gridworld.
- **Deep Value-Based Reinforcement Learning**: implemnenting the DQN algorithm with and owithout experience replay buffer and target network. The Cart Pole environment from the OpenAI Gym was used.
- **Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning**: conducting experiments with two core algorithms: REINFORCE and Actor-Critic using the Catch environment.
